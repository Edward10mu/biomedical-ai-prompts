# Biomedical AI Prompt Portfolio

This repository is a collection of biomedical-focused LLM prompts and their ideal completions.  
It‚Äôs designed to showcase my skills in:

- Prompt engineering for AI models
- Biomedical device and clinical system knowledge
- Clear and accurate technical communication

### Why this exists:
I‚Äôm transitioning from process engineering into AI-assisted biomedical content. This repo documents that journey and serves as a living portfolio for freelance and full-time opportunities.
