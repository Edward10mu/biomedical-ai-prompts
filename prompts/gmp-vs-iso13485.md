# Prompt: GMP vs ISO 13485 in Medical Device Development

**Prompt:**  
You are training a junior biomedical engineer. Explain the difference between GMP and ISO 13485 in the context of medical device development.

**Ideal LLM Answer:**  
GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) refers to a set of general quality standards required by regulatory agencies like the FDA to ensure products are consistently produced and controlled. ISO 13485, on the other hand, is an international standard specifically for medical device quality management systems. While GMP applies broadly to pharmaceuticals and food, ISO 13485 focuses on medical devices and includes additional requirements like risk management and device traceability. In summary, both aim to ensure product safety and quality, but ISO 13485 is more device-specific and harmonized for international compliance.
