# Prompt: Biocompatibility in Implantable Devices

**Prompt:**
You are a biomedical engineer explaining the importance of biocompatibility in implantable medical devices to a new junior engineer. Write a short, clear explanation using real-world examples.

**Ideal LLM Answer:**
Biocompatibility refers to how well a material or device works with the human body without causing adverse reactions. For example, a pacemaker must not trigger immune rejection, corrosion, or blood clotting. Materials like titanium or medical-grade silicone are chosen because they’re stable, non-toxic, and well-tolerated. If a device isn’t biocompatible, it can cause inflammation, infection, or device failure — which risks patient safety.
