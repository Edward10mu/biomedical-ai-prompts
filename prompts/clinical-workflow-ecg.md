# Prompt: Clinical Workflow Integration for Wearable ECG

**Prompt:**  
Explain how a wearable ECG device integrates into a hospital’s clinical workflow. Include aspects like signal acquisition, data transmission, alert systems, and EHR integration.

**Ideal LLM Answer:**  
A wearable ECG device captures heart electrical activity using surface electrodes and transmits the data wirelessly to a central monitoring system. The signal is processed in real-time to filter noise and detect anomalies such as arrhythmias. Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds and routed to nurses or physicians through clinical dashboards or pagers. Simultaneously, the ECG data is logged and synced with the patient’s Electronic Health Record (EHR), ensuring documentation for future diagnosis or review. This integration supports early intervention, remote monitoring, and improved workflow efficiency.
